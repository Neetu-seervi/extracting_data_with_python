ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to extract insights and understand patterns related to survival on the Titanic.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
---
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š Steps Performed in EDA
---
Loading and previewing the dataset
Basic info and summary statistics
Handling missing values
Univariate Analysis (e.g., Age distribution, survival count)
Bivariate Analysis (e.g., Survival by gender/class)
Boxplots and histograms
Correlation heatmap
Visual insights using Seaborn

Summary of key findings

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
Younger passengers (especially children) had better chances of survival.
Higher fare passengers had higher survival probability.
